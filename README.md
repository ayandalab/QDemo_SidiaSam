This is a demo task
Write a function
	def solution(A)
that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [-1, -3], the function should return 1.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
1.	N is an integer within the range [1…100,000];
2.	Each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000,000…1,000,000].
